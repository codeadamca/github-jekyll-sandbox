# GitHub Pages and Jekyll

> **Warning**  
> This repo is a work in progress!

A sandbox for testing out GutHub Pages and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Install Ruby

On a Mac use Homebrew to install Ruby 3.0. A Mac ships with Ruby, but it will be an outdated version. 

```sh
brew install ruby@3.0
```

We do want Ruby first in out PATH, as recommended, run:

```sh
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby@3.0/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Close your Terminal and reopen it. 

## Install Bundler and Jekyll

Run this command to install [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/):

```sh
gem install --user-install bundler jekyll
```
